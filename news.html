      meaning Royal Madrid Football Club), commonly referred to as Real Madrid
      or simply Real, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid.
      Founded on 6 March 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has
      traditionally worn a white home kit since inception. The honorific title
      real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso
      XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. The team has
      played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium
      in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities,
      Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout
      its history. The club was estimated to be worth €3.8 billion ($4.2
      billion) in 2019, and it was the second highest-earning football club in
      the world, with an annual revenue of €757.3 million in 2019.[6][7] The
      club is one of the most widely supported teams in the world.[8] Real
      Madrid is one of three founding members of La Liga that have never been
      relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with
      Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona. The club holds many long-standing
      rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño
      with Atlético Madrid. Real Madrid established itself as a major force in
      both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five
      consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two
      finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with the club
      winning twelve league titles in the span of 16 years. This team, which
      included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Francisco Gento, and Raymond
      Kopa, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest of all
      time.[9][10][11] In domestic football, the club has won 68 trophies; a
      record 35 La Liga titles, 19 Copa del Rey, 12 Supercopa de España, a Copa
      Eva Duarte, and a Copa de la Liga.[12] In European football, Real Madrid
      have won a record 19 trophies;[note 1] a record 13 European Cup/UEFA
      Champions League titles, two UEFA Cups and four UEFA Super Cups. In
      worldwide competitions, they have achieved a record seven club world
      championships.[note 2] Real Madrid was recognised as the FIFA Club of the
      20th Century on 11 December 2000 with 42.35% of the vote,[14] and received
      the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit on 20 May 2004.[15] The club was also
      awarded Best European Club of the 20th Century by the IFFHS on 11 May
      2010. In June 2017, the team succeeded in becoming the first club to win
      consecutive Champions League titles, then made it three in a row and four
      in five seasons in May 2018, extending their lead atop the UEFA club
      rankings. As of May 2022, Real Madrid are ranked fifth behind Bayern
      Munich, Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea.[16]
