        Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ
        ðe ˈfuðβol] (listen), meaning Royal Madrid Football Club), commonly
        referred to as Real Madrid or simply Real, is a Spanish professional
        football club based in Madrid. Founded on 6 March 1902 as Madrid
        Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since
        inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was
        bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the
        royal crown in the emblem. The team has played its home matches in the
        81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947.
        Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios)
        have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The club was
        estimated to be worth €3.8 billion ($4.2 billion) in 2019, and it was
        the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual
        revenue of €757.3 million in 2019.[6][7] The club is one of the most
        widely supported teams in the world.[8] Real Madrid is one of three
        founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top
        division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and
        Barcelona. The club holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably El
        Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. Real
        Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European
        football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six
        overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success
        was replicated on the domestic front, with the club winning twelve
        league titles in the span of 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo
        Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Francisco Gento, and Raymond Kopa, is
        considered by some in the sport to be the greatest of all
        time.[9][10][11] In domestic football, the club has won 68 trophies; a
        record 35 La Liga titles, 19 Copa del Rey, 12 Supercopa de España, a
        Copa Eva Duarte, and a Copa de la Liga.[12] In European football, Real
        Madrid have won a record 19 trophies;[note 1] a record 13 European
        Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, two UEFA Cups and four UEFA Super
        Cups. In worldwide competitions, they have achieved a record seven club
        world championships.[note 2] Real Madrid was recognised as the FIFA Club
        of the 20th Century on 11 December 2000 with 42.35% of the vote,[14] and
        received the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit on 20 May 2004.[15] The club
        was also awarded Best European Club of the 20th Century by the IFFHS on
        11 May 2010. In June 2017, the team succeeded in becoming the first club
        to win consecutive Champions League titles, then made it three in a row
        and four in five seasons in May 2018, extending their lead atop the UEFA
        club rankings. As of May 2022, Real Madrid are ranked fifth behind
        Bayern Munich, Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea.[16]
